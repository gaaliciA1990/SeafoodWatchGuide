    "Description": "Striped bass farmed worldwide in indoor recirculating tanks with wastewater treatment is a Best Choice. Seafood Watch\u0027s analysis concludes that producers that use dry pellet feed will, on average, likely have a yellow feed score. Indoor recirculating systems tend to have low chemical use. However, most producers can release up to 10 percent of daily water flow without treatment, and that water may contain chemicals or their byproducts. Similarly, it\u0027s unlikely the water that\u0027s discharged daily has been disinfected against disease. However, there\u0027s a low risk of disease transmission to wild species when fish are farmed in indoor recirculating tanks because it\u0027s not common for disease outbreaks to occur.",
