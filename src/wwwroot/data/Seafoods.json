    "Description": "Almaco jack farmed in the U.S. in marine net pens is a Good Alternative. While the marine-based ingredients in almaco jack feed are sourced from sustainable fisheries, a high amount of marine products are still required to produce the farmed fish. The open design of net pens means there\u0027s a high risk of escapes. However, genetic impacts on the wild almaco jack population are a low concern because the farmed fish are genetically similar to them. As with any open system, there\u0027s also a risk of disease and parasite transfer between farmed and wild fish, but strong measures are in place to prevent and monitor for outbreaks.",

The stocks aren\u0027t formally assessed, so their status and if overfishing is occurring are unknown. Management is rated moderately effective overall. Local governments have implemented various conservation measures, but a statewide management plan is needed. Handheld rakes, hoes, and shovels are selective harvest methods, so there are no concerns about bycatch. However, these gears can impact habitat, and fishing areas are only closed when the water quality is poor.",
