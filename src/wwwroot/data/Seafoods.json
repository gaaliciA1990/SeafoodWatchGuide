    "Description": "Arctic char caught in Canada's Cambridge Bay (Nunavut Territory) with set gillnets is a 'Best Choice.' The stock is considered healthy, and the fishery is managed well. In addition, overall bycatch and habitat impacts are believed to be low because specific measures are in place to minimize these impacts. Local Inuit community members are the only participants in this fishery. This recommendation covers Arctic char caught in the Ekalluktok, Halokvik, Paliryuak and Jayko Rivers.",

    "Description": "Striped bass farmed worldwide in indoor recirculating tanks with wastewater treatment is a Best Choice. Seafood Watch's analysis concludes that producers that use dry pellet feed will, on average, likely have a yellow feed score. Indoor recirculating systems tend to have low chemical use. However, most producers can release up to 10 percent of daily water flow without treatment, and that water may contain chemicals or their byproducts. Similarly, it's unlikely the water that's discharged daily has been disinfected against disease. However, there's a low risk of disease transmission to wild species when fish are farmed in indoor recirculating tanks because it's not common for disease outbreaks to occur.",

The trotline fishery doesn't catch any other species, and management is rated highly effective. There are no major concerns about seafloor impacts, but ecosystem-based management measures haven't been implemented.",
