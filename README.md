# Fundamental of Software Engineering 2021 Quarter Project

## Main class Project - Seafood Watch Guide Website
For our Fundamentals of Software Engineering, class we worked in a team of 4 to develop a website that was based on the Contoso Crafts template. We exercised Agile Methodologies to implement sprint planning, code reviews, weekly stand ups and task management throughout the lifecycle of the project. Our team (GladitorMonkys) built a website for the Seafood Watch Guide pdfs on Monterey Bay Aquariums website. Our goal was to eliminate the need to download and save a pdf on a users device or carry a physical copy of the guide and instead, provide an easy to use website to view a regions Best, Good and Avoid options for seafood. The site is hosted on Azure.</br>

**Feature Highlights**</br>
- CRUD(i) features for Admins to manage the simple JSON file "database"
- Region select on the home page to easily navigate to the guide
- Filter options in the Admin and Guide pages so users can easily find the fish they want
- Pagination on the Administrators page for easier viewing
- Defensive programming on all forms to be submitted, ensuring only valid data is entered
- Resizability of the website to fit all devices legibly
